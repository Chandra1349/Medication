INTRODUCTION

Our project title is “ Reasoning For Medication”. We have tried our best to make the complicated process of project as simple as possible using python code, tkinter and filehandling etc. Moreover we  have used DFD’s (data flow diagrams) and ER Diagram (Entity Relationship Diagram) to explain the process how to find the way to be free from diseases by knowing their symptoms. We had tried to design the project in such a way that people become free from diseases. The main purpose of my project is to perform each people’s activity in computerized way rather than manually which is time consuming.



BONAFIDE CERTIFICATE  



Certified that this project report “Reason For Medication” is the bonafide work of “Rajkumar ,Chandra Mohan &Chandan” who carried out the project work under my supervision.

AIM OF THE PROJECT:
       As the project is based on“ Reasoning For Medication” so the main aim of the project is to find the types of disease and the way to become free from such diseases.It’s also includes all the expenses and sources of income that’s are used by the people for treatment of diseases. 






MOTIVATION BY THIS PROJECT:
       On the basis of this project we come to know the process how to become free from diseases . Motivation can defined in this project the think which we are able to understood and able to perform for the calculation of this project.We had learnt how to make login page,register page.



OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROCESS:
         The main objectives of this project is to show the income including and excluding all the necessary sources of incrementation and deduction of paying money based on treatment of diseases and being safe from diseases. 
CONTRIBUTION ON THIS PROJECT: 
          For making this webpage firstly ,I have created the Register Page on which we can able to register our own account by making personally. After creating the page ,we can able to login in our own account using correct password and username. Clicking on login page we can go to main page.



ABSTRACTION

Diseases is increasing every year,so there is a need for system to predicate and resolve the increasing rate  of diseases per year.In my project on ““ Reasoning For Medication””, We  tried the  best way to show how the  medication help to resolve  the problem. This has beenachieved by dividing the projects into various modules. 

 
MODULES OF PROJECT:
Reasoning for Medication has designed to computerize the following functions that are performed by the system.
1.	Diseases  detail
2.	Checking in & checking out detail function
3.	Admission of new patients
4.	Checking out by doctor
5.	Checking in of patients
6.	Reasoning For Medicationals details.



 
LIBRARY USED

1.	Numpy:
It is the core library for scientific computing,
which contains a powerful n-dimensionarray object,
provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc.It is also useful 
in linear algebra, random number capability etc.
2.	Pandas: 
It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
3.	Subprocess:
Subprocess is used to link two or more than two python file each other
4.	Tkinter:
Tkinter is  basically used to create Graphic user interface of various apps or websites modules which make more decorative to the project.
6.Call:
           Call function is used to call the operator,system modules,
argument during the create   program.


7.Pickle: 
Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to file.


8. SQL: 
          It is a structured query language which can be used to create table,replace or can also say that is helps for database management system.

















				TESTING
Black box testing, White box testing have been done on the AI algorithm and data models used to implement this AI project.






















REFERENCES:
To conduct this project following tools have been used:
Coursera:	
We used this side for our basic knowledge gain of the methods that will be used in this project. 
https://www.coursera.org/GUI on python

Teacher guidance:
We got help from my teacher that’s are changes which are required during the implementation of project.
YouTube tutorial:
    We had used this sites for solving our different problems which has occurred during the project
